# Heart Rate and Calorie Burn Prediction

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to accurately predict calorie expenditure during workouts, leveraging key fitness metrics. By analyzing historical data encompassing heart rate, total steps, total active minutes, and total distance covered, the models aim to provide insightful predictions of calories burned.

## Features:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, performs feature engineering (extracting day of the week and month from dates), and encodes categorical variables.
* **Outlier Treatment:** Implements a robust outlier treatment method using the Interquartile Range (IQR) to ensure data quality and model accuracy.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilizes correlation matrices and box plots to understand relationships between variables and identify potential issues.
* **Multiple Regression Models:** Explores and compares the performance of several regression algorithms, including:
    * Linear Regression
    * Ridge Regression
    * Lasso Regression
    * Polynomial Regression
    * Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    * Decision Tree Regressor
    * Random Forest Regressor
    * Gradient Boosting Regressor
* **Model Evaluation:** Employs Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared ($R^2$) to assess model performance.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilizes `GridSearchCV` to optimize the hyperparameters for selected models (e.g., Random Forest and Polynomial/Ridge Regression) to achieve the best possible performance.
* **Calorie Prediction:** Provides functionality to predict calorie burn based on new input data for fitness metrics.

## Project Goal:

The primary goal of this project is to develop a reliable machine learning model that can predict the calories burned during a workout, given a user's heart rate and other activity-related variables. This can be beneficial for fitness tracking, personalized workout recommendations, and understanding the efficiency of physical activities.
